# MNIST Classification with PyTorch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
- Builds a simple feedforward neural network.
- Trains the model using backpropagation and optimizers.
- Evaluates the model's performance on test data.
- Visualizes training progress and predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BreyeFoka/MNIST-Classification-with-PyTorch.git
    cd MNIST-Classification-with-PyTorch
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook MNIST_Classification.ipynb
    ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Results
